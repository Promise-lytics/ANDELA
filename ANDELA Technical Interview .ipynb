    "The distance between two strings s and s’ is a similarity coefficient between the two of them. For this particular exercise, we consider a string to have a distance of 0 to another string if it’s equal to it and there is no upper bound on it’s distance. The distance is computed based on the best partial fit s’ has on s or vice-versa, adding 0 for characters in that can align and 1 for every character that does not align. For example, “saint” and “paint” have a distance of 1 as all their characters align but the first one. On the other hand, “ceilings” and “sling” have a distance of 4 as the “ling” sub-string can be aligned but the remaining characters cannot.\n",
    "Implement a function that given two strings, returns the distance between the two.\n",
