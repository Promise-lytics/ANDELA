# ANDELA (String similarity / String distance problem)

The task involves comparing the characters of two strings and calculating the distance between them. 
The distance is computed by adding 0 for characters that can align and 1 for characters that do not align. 
The final distance represents the number of characters that do not match between the two strings, along with any remaining characters in the longer string that cannot be aligned.
